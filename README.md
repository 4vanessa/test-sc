# test-sc
 we have a single HTML file that contains the structure, styling, and logic for the web application. The application displays a heading, a paragraph, a button, and an empty <div> for output.

The JavaScript code adds an event listener to the button element. When the button is clicked, the text content of the output <div> is updated to show the message "Button clicked!"

To run this single-page web application, save the above code in a file with an .html extension (e.g., index.html), and open the file in a web browser. You will see the application rendered, and clicking the "Click Me!" button will update the output area with the message.

Feel free to modify and expand this example to suit your specific needs, such as adding more elements, styling, or implementing additional functionality using JavaScript.
